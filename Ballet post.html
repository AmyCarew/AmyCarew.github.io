			<h1 id="headline">Ballet: A Triple Bill</h1>
			<h2 id="date">12 November 2017</h2>
			<p id="text">The atmosphere of tradition in the Royal Opera House is simultaneously uplifting and a rather heavy burden. As you settle into your seat in this cavernous theatre, gazing onto the illuminated red curtains and right down into the orchestra pit, you can almost feel the ghosts of performances past. Operas, ballets, plays and other concerts have been staged on the site of the Royal Opera House since 1732 and in the current building since 1858. These ghosts are of the encouraging sort. They provide a base on which to extend the performing culture started here many years ago. But the more you think about them, the more there seem to be, crowding the empty space above the stalls, straining at the roof as others push from beneath.</p>
			<p id="text">It was an exercise in contrast, then, against the sublime weight of this tradition, to watch three ballets of contemporary choreography recently: The Illustrated ‘Farewell’, The Wind, and Untouchable. All were very different and progressively pushed the boundaries of the comfortable and familiar. Like in visual art over the last century in particular, although not to the same degree, there has been a tendency towards subversion in ballet which was illustrated in microcosm on this particular evening.</p>
			<p id="text">The Illustrated ‘Farewell’ is choreographed by Twyla Tharp to Haydn’s Symphony no.45, also known as the Farewell Symphony. Overall it retains a strong sense of classical tradition: the beautiful and pure pas de deux, the attention to line in the choreography, the strict delineation between male and female dancers. The music, though classical, is the first, very subtle hint of something edgy. Haydn wrote it in the rather uncomfortable key of F sharp minor and the unusual final movement includes a slower coda-like section and ends pianissimo. What really makes this ballet contemporary though are the lightest of whimsical touches: the dancers leaving the stage casually flat-footed at the end of movements, short sections performed in silence and the occasional humorous gesture, eliciting murmurs of laughter from the audience. The sense on leaving the theatre after this first ballet is of having witnessed something exceptionally beautiful but something that overall you expected.</p>
			<p id="text">There are elements of the traditional in The Wind too. It is a character ballet with a particular story to tell. Based on the book and film of the same name and choreographed by Arthur Pita, it sensitively renders into dance form the trials and terrors of a young woman’s move from Virginia to Texas in the late 19th century. The staging and the newly composed score give it an important contemporary edge. Much of the drama and tension is created by the presence of three wind-making machines. Reminiscent of large, ultra-modern pieces of farming equipment, the machines and the effect they create on the dancers, costumes and props add a relentless element to a piece of strong choreography. Pita chose not to depict the story’s rape scene on the stage. This was not a contentious point as much as it highlighted yet another example of how so much on-stage or on-screen drama comes from the rape, abuse or suppression of women. The difference to the first ballet was that the staging was ingenious and unexpected, although the storyline was all too familiar.</p>
			<p id="text">Untouchable, then, came as a refreshing surprise. Although it premiered at the Royal Opera House in 2015, it felt new and rebellious. The choreographer, Hofesh Shechter, also composed the score, along with Nell Catchpole. All the dancers wore similar costumes, like army fatigues, and no one was en pointe. There were also no obvious principals or soloists in this ballet. Much of the dancing was performed in a military-style grid with a single synchronised clap at intervals throughout the slightly sinister, percussive score. The choreography often crossed the line away from classical ballet. Once you have seen this ballet you understand why, before it premiered, Shechter was concerned that it should be ‘understandable to a Royal Opera House audience’.</p>
			<p id="text">But is that why we go to the ballet, the opera, the theatre, the art gallery? To be provided with something we understand? If the Impressionists had not dared to experiment and then exhibit in the face of establishment disapproval, there may have been no modern art. If the suffragettes had not had the courage to protest against male supremacy, women may not have won the right to vote. Without the vision of people who see beyond the status quo, who are inventive and creative and brave, there would be nothing worth leaving your home to see. </p>
			<p id="text">Ballet or dance is almost the perfect medium to explore change as the skill is at once very foreign to a spectator but also identifiable because it is to do with the body. This thought reminds me of the literary term, defamiliarisation or ‘making strange’: presenting something familiar in an unfamiliar way in order to heighten insight. It encourages you to talk and think. It is open to more than one interpretation. It is inclusive. </p>
			<p id="text">My conclusion is that each of the ballets achieved this to a greater or lesser degree, perhaps progressively more in the order in which they were performed. Without being at the expense of exquisite craftsmanship, what you really want from performance art, any art, is something with a frisson of excitement, an undercurrent of quirkiness or discomfort to send those old ghosts rushing for the nearest exit.</p>
