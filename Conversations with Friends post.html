			<h1 id="headline">Conversations with Friends by Sally Rooney</h1>
			<h2 id="date">20 October 2017</h2>
			<p id="text">Conversations with Friends, by young Irish author Sally Rooney, is a refreshingly modern take on the familiar fodder of the coming-of-age novel: relationships, love and that feeling of being on the threshold of adulthood. The principal relationship is the one between Frances and Bobbi, two young women who were lovers for over a year and are now very close friends. The story is just what the title suggests: the conversations we hear about through Frances’ first person narration and those that we (and Frances herself) assume have happened.</p>
			<p id="text">It begins during the summer after the pair’s third year at university. They perform spoken-word poetry together and are this way thrown into the path of Melissa, a writer and photographer, and her actor husband, Nick. Melissa, being much older, takes them under her wing, entertaining them at her house and promising to write a profile on them. She and Bobbi develop a close attachment, leaving Frances paired off with Nick. The fact that Melissa and Nick are partially estranged gives the foursome an uneasy tension; the resulting adultery seems inevitable.</p>
			<p id="text">The novel is ultimately concerned with tone and particularly how this may be manipulated in online conversations. Some of the dialogue is conducted via instant messaging and email. Interestingly this is very easy to distinguish from the normal prose of the novel, compared to the verbal dialogue which is not contained within quotation marks. There is irony and humour in abundance amongst Frances’s description, discourse and stream of consciousness. Overall it appears to be simple, plain storytelling, but we are left wondering whether this delivery masks something deeper.</p>
			<p id="text">The immediacy of communication in today’s world is emphasised. Despite this immediacy and somewhat ironically, the online, written messages are highly edited and often second-guessed. Frances uses her conversations with Nick online to create another persona: “I hadn’t seen Nick in real life for what seemed like a long time, and I felt a little nervous about it, because of how droll and indifferent I had pretended to be in all our emails.”</p>
			<p id="text">This is linked to another theme of the book: identity and the struggles we experience with our own identities while growing up. Rooney is masterful in her treatment of this subject and the inherent self-absorption that comes with it. We can identify with Frances when she laments, “Things matter to me more than they do to normal people.” When she is briefly rejected by Nick, she expresses the irrational childishness that we have all felt: “At times I thought this was the worst misery I had experienced in my life, but it was also a very shallow misery, which at any time could have been relieved completely by a word from him and transformed into idiotic happiness.”</p>
			<p id="text">Despite what happens with Nick, Frances is inextricably linked with Bobbi and, in fact, idolises her. Everything she does is coloured by what Bobbi says or might think or an internal debate on whether she should tell Bobbi at all. Initially she allowed their relationship to give her a personality. In describing how she and Bobbi fell in love, she says, “When Bobbi talked about me it felt like seeing myself in a mirror for the first time.” In this way the novel makes us think about how we see ourselves and one another. Later she says, “I liked to imagine that I looked like Bobbi. She had better posture than me and a memorably beautiful face. The pretence was so real to me that when I accidentally caught sight of my reflection and saw my own appearance, I felt a strange, depersonalising shock.” </p>
			<p id="text">Rooney’s strength is in beautifully drawn characters and pitch-perfect narration so I found the few similes she included jarring. I had very few other gripes with the book. It manages to be both funny and serious, and the tension implicit in the storyline is admirably maintained. </p>
			<p id="text">This is Rooney’s first novel and it feels like the right one to have written. It is a wonderfully contemporary commentary on love and growing up in our times.</p>
