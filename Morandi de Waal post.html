			<h1 id="headline">Morandi / Edmund de Waal</h1>
			<h2 id="date">18 June 2017</h2>
			<p id="text">When I visited Stockholm for the first time recently, I was struck most by how water creates space in the city, providing perspective and allowing the eye to travel freely. This is in great contrast to London, where the city centre is such a jumble of buildings that, dwarfed, you often look inward instead of up and outward.</p>
			<p id="text">I experienced a similar feeling when visiting an exhibition of Edmund de Waal’s and Giorgio Morandi’s work at Artipelag, just outside Stockholm. It is about space: creating space and how objects are placed in a space and in relation to one another. It is about seeing and hearing and thinking. Light and shadow. Memory.</p>
			<p id="text">The obvious common thread running through the work of de Waal and Morandi is the repetition of an object or a motif. </p>
			<p id="text">In de Waal’s case, it is the hundreds of cylindrical, ceramic vessels. Varying in height, colour and diameter, these are arranged on shelves and in vitrines, standing alone, grouped together, above your head. You weave through them, walk under them, gaze from a distance, inspect closely. While you might be able to move, to change perspective, their stillness is absolute.</p>
			<p id="text">A similar theme of repetition runs through many of Morandi’s still lives. Three, four or five vessels are grouped together; occasionally there may be one on its own. The colour palette is muted, the shadows perfectly rendered, but each work emits a soft glow, seeming to emanate from the jars and jugs themselves. Again you can look at them from different angles, from near or far, but the images are perfectly still.</p>
			<p id="text">Everything is carefully and beautifully considered. The only thing missing, and perhaps intentionally so, is an element of surprise, like the leap of the heart when, walking through those narrow, over-shadowed streets of London, you come upon a building like St Paul’s Cathedral, out of nowhere and perfectly formed. Rather, walking around this exhibition is a kind of meditation. The space and the works inspire quiet contemplation, a credit to the artists, of course, and the co-curator, Bo Nilsson. And like meditation, the revelation comes slowly and gently from within.</p>
