			<h1 id="headline">Collect 2018</h1>
			<h2 id="date">2 March 2018</h2>
			<p id="text">My favourite display at last weekend’s Collect 2018, The International Art Fair for Contemporary Objects, was presented by the Joya Barcelona Art Jewellery Fair. Instead of showing the work mounted on the wall, in cases, or on plinths, they had created a three dimensional space of undulating curves attached to two sides of the stand. It reminded me of loosely folded paper or the heaviest draped fabric. And pinned onto this were brooches made by four different artists, like tiny decorations on a dramatic oversized lapel.</p>
			<p id="text">This display both surrounded the delicate things, and gave space to them. They included a collection of small hoops containing paper, old syringe needles, and what looked like charcoal (but was in fact silver and fine gold granulation): far greater than the sum of their parts. Mini sculptures of scalloped brass, which made me think of sea-anemones, in various colours. And multiple beaded strings, some like filigree, others like delicate seaweed, in aquatic hues with bursts of chartreuse.</p>
			<p id="text">There were so many beautiful objects at this fair, I hardly knew where to look. I was drawn to the ceramic vessels, which have a promise of utility beneath their beauty. A collection of cylinders by Ashraf Hanna, shaped like slightly distorted organ pipes, caught my eye. A vibrant yellow-green bowl, beautifully simple, by Emmanuel Cooper was part of the ‘Masters of British Studio Pottery’ display. Pots shaped with tiny pixels of roof tiles by Thomas Nathan invited closer inspection, endearing and playful.</p>
			<p id="text">Most of all, I felt comforted by the assurance in all around me of things made by people with the basic materials of our earth, with their hands and imaginations.</p>
