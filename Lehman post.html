			<h1 id="headline">The Lehman Trilogy</h1>
			<h2 id="date">23 September 2018</h2>
			<p id="text">We watched The Lehman Trilogy at the National Theatre on 18 September 2018, almost ten years to the day after the news broke of Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy, spelling the start of the global financial crisis.</p>
			<p id="text">This play in three parts, written by Stefano Massini and adapted by Ben Power, tells the story of the Lehman brothers, both the actual people and the empire they created which bore their name. It is humane and humorous, has very little to do with a global financial services firm, and is much more about the lives behind that name. There are perils and pride to associating your name with your business and it seems a shame to me that, from that fateful day in 2008 onwards, the Lehman brothers will only be remembered as the bank that wasn’t too big to fail, although this play does a lot to put that right.</p>
			<p id="text">It begins with the arrival of Hayum Lehman in New York, fresh off the boat from Bavaria, in 1844. He quickly changes his name to Henry, a first sign of the seemingly inherent adaptability of this man, and immigrants in general. It is a poignant moment, and personal for me, as my 19th century Jewish forebears left Bavaria around the same time and changed their name too. He relatively quickly sets up a small business in Alabama, selling cotton, and is soon joined by his two brothers. I loved the relationship between these three and deservingly they are given the bulk of the story, as they evolve into cotton brokers, and eventually, with the influence of subsequent generations, a bank.</p>
			<p id="text">What struck me most was the repetition at the heart of this play. The repetition of the name Lehman in each incarnation of the family business. Repetition of words, repetition down the generations, of disasters that happened and opportunities that arose, all inevitably repeated. Even the characters contained some sort of continuity, as they are all played by only three actors, Simon Russell Beale, Adam Godley and Ben Miles.</p>
			<p id="text">The complete mastery of these three over an intense amount of dialogue (the play is three hours long) was astonishing. On top of that, I was amazed at the nuance they used to differentiate each character, with no costume changes, few props, and a slightly sterile set. This was physical acting at its understated best. I loved the way that the story was part narrated and part inhabited by these characters, enhancing the storytelling aspect of it and further emphasised by the way the actors attentively listened to one another as they spoke.</p>
			<p id="text">I think the set served the play well and didn’t distract from its central element – people. It is designed as a rotating office space, replete with corporate furniture, bankers' boxes and glass walls. It neatly evoked the 21st century disaster that is not covered here. Changing screens as the backdrop to the stage softened the overall effect and were used cleverly to enhance aspects of the storyline and provide a sense of place.</p>
			<p id="text">I was at university in South Africa on the day Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. I remember it clearly even though I didn’t really understand what it meant then. I don’t think many people did. Reading the news and discussing it with lecturers and fellow students, I couldn’t help but feel that frisson of excitement which accompanies any disaster. After seeing The Lehman Trilogy, it made me glad I now know the history behind the name, albeit ten years late.</p>
