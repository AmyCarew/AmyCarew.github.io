			<h1 id="headline">Lohengrin</h1>
			<h2 id="date">3 July 2018</h2>
			<p id="text">There is something about live music, about being in the same space as the sounds, without digital or electronic intervention, which can’t be matched. This is particularly true of opera, where there is no use even of amplification. In my very short but joyous acquaintance with the art form, it is what I’ve found most wonderful.</p>
			<p id="text">The prelude to Wagner’s ‘Lohengrin’, played in the Royal Opera House by its superlative orchestra, was truly one of the most beautiful things I have ever heard. Wagner’s own words describe it best: ‘like streams of gold, ravishing the senses of the beholder’. I listened to a recording subsequently and it can be only a tantalising reminder of the sounds of those soft violins rising up from the depths of the pit and swelling until they surround you on all sides, like the touch of sunlight on the skin.</p>
			<p id="text">The first few operas I saw were in Italian. Initially I thought I preferred the syllabic, flamboyant drama of Italian singing to German or English. But having listened to a few concerts of Schubert, Schumann and other German songs performed by the Young Artists of the Royal Opera House, I found myself loving the precise consonant sounds and flattened vowels of the German singing. The clipped, structured words were a perfect counterpoint to the flowing strings, woodwind and muted brass of the orchestra in this particular opera.</p>
			<p id="text">The performance of the singers, the chorus, the orchestra and above all the conductor, Andris Nelsons, eclipsed the storyline of Lohengrin. It is an awkward story, very much a fairy tale, but also grounded in grim reality, particularly emphasised by the contemporary, minimal staging of this production. That Elsa escapes death, falls in love with a man without a name (who is actually a knight of the Holy Grail), marries him and then loses him, all apparently within two days, is a lot to believe. But, as I’ve discovered in opera, leaps of imagination and suspension of belief are a prerequisite, with a focus on dramatic themes and grand gestures. The fact that it’s all the very antithesis of my real life is so much part of the appeal.</p>
			<p id="text">With a running time of four and a half hours (including two intervals), I expected to be bored or doze off. In fact, I was rapt throughout. The chorus singing was particularly rousing and strong. The appearance of the characters in the aisles of the auditorium after the first interval was a lovely, light touch. The horns blaring out from a box just above and behind our heads was wonderfully dramatic. It was full of contrasts: the brutalist and bleak red brick structures of the first half, against the white, light marital chamber of the second. The ineffectual King Heinrich against the self-assured purity of Lohengrin. The malice and worldliness of the sorceress Ortrud and the naiveté of Elsa.</p>
			<p id="text">I could have made all sorts of comparisons to our society today or tried to find a contemporary meaning in a 10th century story brought to life by a composer in the 1800s. Instead I left the theatre very reluctantly, accompanied solely by the memory of that music, which through it all, almost literally, shone.</p>
