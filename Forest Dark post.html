			<h1 id="headline">Forest Dark by Nicole Krauss</h1>
			<h2 id="date">19 September 2017</h2>
			<p id="text">In beautiful, measured prose, Nicole Krauss starts out her new book, Forest Dark, with the disappearance of Jules Epstein. We are immediately immersed into the life of this man, an American lawyer-turned-philanthropist who “wasn’t large, only uncontainable.” Beginning like this with Epstein’s vanishing, there is a sense of calm inevitability about the first chapter, as we read about the death of his parents, his divorce and, much to his son’s chagrin, the voluntary distribution of his (extremely valuable) possessions. The increasing mystery of it draws you in and bears you on.</p>
			<p id="text">Alternate chapters are narrated in the first person by Nicole, a successful writer living in New York City. She is disillusioned by her marriage and struggling to write her next novel. She recounts an eerie experience she has “one autumn afternoon when I came through the door of the house I shared with my husband and our two children, and sensed that I was already there.”</p>
			<p id="text">It is through this character that Krauss most directly (and possibly semi-autobiographically) explores the questions of self that are a key concern of this novel. How we construct ourselves, how we inhabit our lives, how our identities are formed and broken. She is masterful in describing our innermost thoughts using simple, expressive language: “One could say that the sense of self is still porous in young children. That the oceanic feeling persists for some time until the scaffolding is at last removed from the walls we labor to build around ourselves under the command of an innate instinct, however touched by the sadness that comes of knowing we’ll spend the rest of our lives searching for an escape.”</p>
			<p id="text">Both Epstein and Nicole are driven to Tel Aviv by a strange impulse, each seeking not answers but something more elusive which neither of them can quite define. That they are then lead on separate, almost implausible escapades enhances the current of unreality that ripples beneath the surface of this novel. If I say that these escapades involve, variously, a rabbi, a film shoot, Kafka, a dog and the desert, you may say how? But Krauss weaves the threads together with skill and imagination.</p>
			<p id="text">Krauss’s work is richly referenced and strongly evokes spaces and places: the Tel Aviv Hilton, wintry New York, a childhood home, the desert. She also frequently uses the ocean and sea to describe people, relationships and the identity: water as another space to contain our bodies and our thoughts.</p>
			<p id="text">The tautness and urgency builds wonderfully throughout the book. The alternation in each chapter between the two spaces of Epstein’s life and Nicole’s makes us wonder when or if they will intersect. Reading on, we soon realise that it is less black and white than this: the different realities are in fact deftly layered over one another. Nonetheless, it reinforces one of the major themes: alternative identities, alternative realities, alternative endings, and the hope these hold. </p>
			<p id="text">On finishing the last page I sat quite still for a few moments. The book came to me at a time of change and discovery in my own life, a strange coincidence echoing the experiences of the characters in the story. It has inspired me to progress further “in the deep, bitter, bright education of the self”. I am still haunted by it. </p>
