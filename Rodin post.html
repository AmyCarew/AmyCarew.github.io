			<h1 id="headline">Rodin and the Art of Ancient Greece</h1>
			<h2 id="date">17 July 2018</h2>
			<p id="text">This exhibition is one of those that’s been on for ages and which I’d been meaning to see, finally managing to get there a few weeks before it closes later this month. We went on a sweltering Saturday morning in the middle of a miraculously long, hot summer, and it felt like entering a sanctuary. A beautiful, big, cool gallery in the heart of the otherwise buzzing British Museum, sectioned off but still very open, the amazing volume of the space emphasised.</p>
			<p id="text">I thought I knew Rodin quite well: I have been to the Musée Rodin in Paris and seen his sculptures at the V&A. But somehow I never more than subconsciously linked his work to that of the Ancient Greek masters. It all seems so obvious now, especially Rodin’s love of the fragmentary, inspired by the ruins of the Parthenon and the sculpture of Phidias.</p>
			<p id="text">I was completely ignorant of the amount of reference that went into his work, both the sculpture of the ancients and other less physical sources. It was Dante’s ‘Divine Comedy’ which provided the basis for ‘The Gates of Hell’, which became his life’s work. Even ‘The Thinker’ started life as part of this monumental scene.</p>
			<p id="text">Beautiful examples of Rodin’s sculptures are juxtaposed against ancient ones, all carefully chosen and not overcrowded or overthought. The highlight, predictably, is ‘The Kiss’: a remarkable physical embodiment of one moving moment. It is displayed next to a particularly fine example of ancient sculpture, two women lying close together, the drapery of each of their individual garments almost indistinguishable from the other. There is so much emotion contained on this one plinth that I was quite overcome.</p>
			<p id="text">Only after seeing ‘The Walking Man’ at the end of the exhibition, and reading about it, did I think of the moments before and after what Rodin is depicting in his work, the fact that this stillness represents one second, less than that, with all of life flowing to and from it on either side. It was interesting to read his views on photography, which he regarded as inadequate for conveying this. Perhaps because it is too static, too instant, where sculpture and drawing are more fluid, dependent on time and driven by process. These thoughts were illustrated in another statue from Ancient Greece, ‘Rising Goddess’, a woman sculpted in the act of rising from her seat, the exquisite drapery across her knees suggesting the tension of this movement, paused now and held motionless for all time (which 2,500 years may as well be compared with our fleeting lives).</p>
			<p id="text">Also exhibited is ‘The Burghers of Calais’ which contains some of the most intense storytelling I’ve encountered that doesn’t use words. I loved the thought of Rodin shaping all these emotions physically, with his own hands.</p>
			<p id="text">It amazed me anew to see in how many ways the ‘Divine Comedy’ is referenced, in literature itself and in art. Its characters, themes, drama and creativity are unsurpassed in richness. I am currently reading Clive James’s mesmerising translation, which has been his life’s work too. I wrote a piece last year on Nicole Krauss’s novel, ‘Forest Dark’, which takes its title from the opening of the ‘Inferno’. In it, I wrote of ‘the questions of self that are a key concern of this novel. How we construct ourselves, how we inhabit our lives, how our identities are formed and broken.’ This came back to me on seeing Rodin’s work.</p>
			<p id="text">Many of the captions to the pieces in this exhibition contain the words of Rainer Maria Rilke, the poet and at one stage Rodin’s secretary. In one, he says, ‘Here was life, a thousand-fold in every moment, in longing and sorrow, in madness and fear, in loss and gain.’ And in another, ‘He created the man who holds his bowed head in both hands as if to collect himself to be alone for one more moment.’</p>
			<p id="text">As with the ‘Divine Comedy’, it all comes back to self-discovery. Discovery for its own sake. Rodin himself said, ‘I invent nothing, I rediscover.’ And for his rediscovery and by consequence mine, I am grateful.</p>
