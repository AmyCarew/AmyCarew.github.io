			<h1 id="headline">Yugen - The Royal Ballet</h1>
			<h2 id="date">26 March 2018</h2>
			<p id="text">Leonard Bernstein’s ‘Chichester Psalms’ are by turns rousing, light, angular, playful and exquisite. I could use exactly those words to describe the choreography of Wayne McGregor’s new ballet, Yugen, which premiered at the Royal Opera House earlier this month. I thought it was fresh, spare and the perfect response to this extraordinary piece of music.</p>
			<p id="text">In preparation for seeing the ballet, I listened to the Chichester Psalms on my phone. But nothing could prepare me for the wonder of a live performance by a full orchestra and choir. The distilled perfection of the lone child’s voice at the start of II. Psalm 23 and Psalm 2:1-4 came as if from the subterranean depths of a large cave. The contrasts and bursts were heightened and bright.</p>
			<p id="text">I love the combination of voice and instruments, and to layer dance on top of these I find very moving. There was another layer I was eager to see in this ballet, as the set was designed by Edmund de Waal, the potter and writer, and to me instantly recognisably so.</p>
			<p id="text">Five tall columns were placed mid-stage, irregularly spaced, like giant, narrow versions of the vitrines he uses to display his pots. They acted as containers for stationary dancers before their turn to dance, or as a space to wait while others were dancing. Sometimes all were lit; at one beautiful moment just one was – stark and alone. Their frames cast lovely angular shadows across the front of the stage. Behind them was a black void, where dancers appeared and disappeared. As usual with de Waal, it was as much, if not more, about the spaces created around these columns as the columns themselves.</p>
			<p id="text">All dressed in shades of red and plum, the dancers stood out against the monochrome simplicity of the staging. They danced together and separately, woman with man, man with man, woman with woman, and in groups too. The choreography beautifully contrasted energy with grace. There was something bird or animal like in their movements, enhanced by the sense of escaping a cage as they took turns to leave the confines of the vitrines to move onto and across the stage.</p>
			<p id="text">Overall I was left with the sense that this is how our hearts or souls would dance, sing or play, if they could. And in fact perhaps they do.</p>
