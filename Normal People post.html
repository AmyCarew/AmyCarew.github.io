			<h1 id="headline">Normal People by Sally Rooney
			<h2 id="date">18 October 2018</h2>
			<p id="text">I first read Little Women when I was about nine or ten. It’s the first proper, chunky novel I remember attempting. It was also my mother’s copy, the book she was reading while pregnant with me, the source of my name. Two things distinctly struck me at the time: it was a thick enough book that the spine had been broken and it had sentences that ran on over the turn of a page. It remains my seminal reading experience. I can still recall the joy of immersing myself in that sweet, foreign world, the voraciousness with which I attacked the words, the tears I shed.</p>
			<p id="text">A few times I have finished a book and wanted immediately to begin it again, to preserve and extend that precious feeling of living another life, not wanting to let go of a new friend or a new love. I did reread Little Women many times over my adolescence. And as I grew older, I experienced something similar with Brother of the More Famous Jack by Barbara Trapido and Learning to Swim by Clare Chambers, books that conjured up a different country, with strong female heroines in various stages of growing up, finding themselves in heady relationships and strange situations. Iron Love by Marguerite Poland, though set in my home country of South Africa, is from a completely different time, the early 20th century, and in this case I fell in love with the schoolboy hero of the story, Charlie Fraser. These are books I return to when I need comfort, an escape from reality, a reminder of a person I used to be.</p>
			<p id="text">I don’t think it’s a coincidence that they are all coming-of-age novels. It speaks to the age I am right now and my experience of the world so far. For the same reason, I don’t think it’s a coincidence that Sally Rooney’s two novels are about young adults finding their way from childhood into grown-up life. Her first, Conversations with Friends, is an amazing book: clever and witty and bright. But Normal People, her second and nominated for the Man Booker Prize this year, completely eclipses it.</p>
			<p id="text">Firstly it is a contemporary love story which manages to be all the more powerful for its understatedness. Connell and Marianne are at school together in small town Ireland when their association begins and, inevitably, both end up at Trinity College, Dublin. Their lives move loosely in parallel, at times intersecting and then veering away. The novel is peopled with several other characters but it is these two and their interchanges which shine out from the pages, keeping them swiftly turning as you long for more, both from and for them.</p>
			<p id="text">Rooney’s writing is not heavy in lyrical description of time and place but when she does include it in this book, it is beautiful and perfectly weighted. She talks of ‘the stale smell of classrooms, the tinny intercom bell that sounded between lessons, the dark austere trees that stood like apparitions around the basketball court. The slow routine work of copying out notes in different-coloured pens on fresh blue-and-white lined paper.’ Midway through a particularly awkward meeting between Connell and Marianne, deep into their relationship, her imagery echoes their discomfort: ‘Back outside the cafe now, the sunlight is so strong it crunches all the colours up and makes them sting.’ In a section of the book that was the pinnacle of the story for me, ‘[t]he cherries hang around them gleaming like so many spectral planets.’ And when you get the feeling that things may finally be falling into place for our protagonists, Marianne’s thoughts are this: ‘Dublin is extraordinarily beautiful to her in wet weather, the way grey stone darkens to black, and rain moves over the grass and whispers on slick roof tiles.’</p>
			<p id="text">It is Rooney’s ear for dialogue and interior monologue though which truly elevates this novel to the extraordinary. The way her young people talk to one another, both in person and online, is current and relatable but somehow still retains a sense of classic timelessness. You are aware of the setting and era but the focus is so much on the two central characters, their thoughts, and the push and pull, ebb and flow of their relationship, that you feel this story will be read for many years to come.</p>
			<p id="text">I devoured it in two days, almost unable to put it down, and, even in that short time, I felt like I knew Connell and Marianne, every aspect of their lives, like they were my oldest friends, even that I was them, one or the other or both at the same time. At the end, I couldn’t bear to be parted from them and immediately began it again.</p>
