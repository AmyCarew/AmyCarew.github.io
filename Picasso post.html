			<h1 id="headline">Picasso 1932 - Love, Fame, Tragedy</h1>
			<h2 id="date">17 June 2018</h2>
			<p id="text">Picasso polarises. He is a love him or hate him kind of figure. Even within his body of work, there are some paintings you love and some you hate. One of his driving forces seemed to be the desire to shock people. He moved from one thing, one style to the next with astonishing frequency.</p>
			<p id="text">Which is why this exhibition, ‘Picasso 1932 – Love, Fame, Tragedy’, works. With many other artists the output of one year would not be varied and remarkable enough to weave a story around. Not so with Picasso. By selecting a year, the number of works to choose from is usefully limited but the contrasts and intensity are heightened. This is clever curation and an easy idea for audiences to see and understand, particularly refreshing when the concepts of some of these blockbuster shows can be overly general, tenuous, or downright misleading.</p>
			<p id="text">What I enjoyed about this exhibition was that it made me think. I can walk around several rooms of Monets in raptures but in many ways Picasso is more interesting. His paintings make you question why you like something or why you don’t. Personally I found the profusion of purple skin disturbing, although I loved his use of colour, including touches of that same purple, in his still lifes.</p>
			<p id="text">The sudden introduction of geometric shapes into his paintings from late March to May of 1932 felt odd but illustrates his relentless experimentation well. He is quoted as saying, ‘You start a painting and it becomes something altogether different. It’s strange how little the artist’s will matters.’</p>
			<p id="text">Initially I found the choice to include several much earlier portraits mid-way through the exhibition a strange one, although this tied in with the retrospective he mounted in June 1932, as many of these were exhibited there. They are far more realist in style: soft and painterly. I loved the ghostly ‘Girl in a Chemise’ from his Blue Period. With hindsight, I thought this worked as a way of highlighting the variety of his work, while also throwing into relief the aesthetic he created in 1932.</p>
			<p id="text">His drawings are peaceful: because they are free from hectic colours, it is easier to see the forms they depict and to appreciate the purity of Picasso’s lines. One wall was filled with small works, loose combinations of ink and paint, which were a delight to inspect closely.</p>
			<p id="text">I won’t get into the phallic shapes I kept seeing everywhere, the womanising, and the accusations of misogyny. Although a large part of the exhibition rests on his affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter, her role as subject, not lover, is emphasised, despite the impression that for Picasso these two were closely intertwined. The year ended supposedly tragically when she became pregnant and his wife found out and left him. I have the feeling he wasn’t so much sorry for what he did, but sorry he was caught. Regardless, I think he would have appreciated the legacy left behind by this seminal year, and agreed with the words used to describe it: love, fame and tragedy.</p>
