			<h1 id="headline">Keeping an Eye Open by Julian Barnes</h1>
			<h2 id="date">9 March 2018</h2>
			<p id="text">I recently listened to a BBC Radio 4 interview between the writer Mark Haddon and the painter Tai-Shan Schierenberg. It was a fascinating discussion of their childhoods and professions, as they tried to find similarities in their work and working methods.</p>
			<p id="text">I’m not sure they came very close to bridging this gap, or whether it should even be bridged. In both painting and writing, there are elements of creation and elements of response, but each is positioned differently (and is constantly moving around) on this continuum. Julian Barnes, in his book ‘Keeping an Eye Open’, comes closer to defining a link which resonates with me. ‘It is a rare picture which stuns, or argues, us into silence. And if one does, it is only a short time before we want to explain and understand the very silence into which we have been plunged.’</p>
			<p id="text">This is the premise of Barnes’ book, a group of seventeen masterful essays on art, focusing chiefly on the period between 1850 and 1920. I was drawn to it at the start of my own attempt to write about art. In fact, I first knew about it from researching a piece on Degas (Barnes wrote a wonderful essay ‘Degas: And Women’ in defence of the man as misogynist, which is included in this collection). The first essay in the book comes from one of his novels, ‘A History of the World in 10½ Chapters’ (1989), and is the story of both a painting and an historical event, Géricault’s ‘The Raft of Medusa’.</p>
			<p id="text">Several other artists and their art are given the Barnes’ treatment familiar to me from his novels and writing: beautifully detailed descriptions of people, places and things, written in a tone of conviction, gentle irony and slight sadness. I loved the piece on Vuillard, where Barnes talks about his top ten favourite paintings, a frequently shifting and ‘over a hundred’ strong list. The collection as a whole is both more interesting and funnier than I expected. There is much self-deprecation and a recognition that the art itself really doesn’t care what we think of it. ‘We wander through the great galleries, appreciative or dismissive according to our knowledge, our temperament, the state of our digestion, and the fashion of our times. […] But the art goes on regardless, above our heads, massive and uncaring.’</p>
			<p id="text">The final two essays are about Lucian Freud and Howard Hodgkin. Barnes was a close friend of Hodgkin and the difference in his positive attitude towards him, and a rather negative attitude towards Freud, is notable. This sudden personalising provided a stark and strange contrast to the other pieces where the artists are treated with a much greater sense of distance.</p>
			<p id="text">Barnes’ elegant, eloquent writing made for effortless reading. In their conversation, Haddon and Schierenberg discussed the tension between subject and medium, how in a painting there is the surface, the physical paint, and also what is being painted. At times you see one, at times the other, and occasionally, magically, both at the same time. This ‘slippage’ as Schierenberg called it, allows you to engage in the activity of looking. ‘Keeping an Eye Open’ performed something similar for me: the lucidity of Barnes’ prose left space in my mind to see and think beyond just the words on the page. I found so much to aspire to in this book and, at the same time, felt privileged to share in the sensation which inspires Barnes: ‘Art doesn’t just capture and convey the excitement, the thrill of life. Sometimes, it does even more: it <i>is</i> that thrill.’</p>
