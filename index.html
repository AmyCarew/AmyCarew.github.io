			<h1 id="headline">Forest Dark by Nicole Krauss</h1>
			<h2 id="date">19 September 2017</h2>
			<p id="text">In beautiful, measured prose, Nicole Krauss starts out her new book, Forest Dark, with the disappearance of Jules Epstein. We are immediately immersed into the life of this man, an American lawyer-turned-philanthropist who “wasn’t large, only uncontainable.” Beginning like this with Epstein’s vanishing, there is a sense of calm inevitability about the first chapter, as we read about the death of his parents, his divorce and, much to his son’s chagrin, the voluntary distribution of his (extremely valuable) possessions. The increasing mystery of it draws you in and bears you on.</p>
