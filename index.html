			<h1 id="headline">The Lehman Trilogy</h1>
			<h2 id="date">23 September 2018</h2>
			<p id="text">We watched The Lehman Trilogy at the National Theatre on 18 September 2018, almost ten years to the day after the news broke of Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy, spelling the start of the global financial crisis.</p>
			<p id="text">This play in three parts, written by Stefano Massini and adapted by Ben Power, tells the story of the Lehman brothers, both the actual people and the empire they created which bore their name. It is humane and humorous, has very little to do with a global financial services firm, and is much more about the lives behind that name. There are perils and pride to associating your name with your business and it seems a shame to me that, from that fateful day in 2008 onwards, the Lehman brothers will only be remembered as the bank that wasn’t too big to fail, although this play does a lot to put that right.</p>
