			<p id="text">I first read Little Women when I was about nine or ten. It’s the first proper, chunky novel I remember attempting. It was also my mother’s copy, the book she was reading while pregnant with me, the source of my name. Two things distinctly struck me at the time: it was a thick enough book that the spine had been broken and it had sentences that ran on over the turn of a page. It remains my seminal reading experience. I can still recall the joy of immersing myself in that sweet, foreign world, the voraciousness with which I attacked the words, the tears I shed.</p>
