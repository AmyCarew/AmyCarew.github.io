			<p id="text">The first awards-season screening of 'The Post' was held in New York City in November last year, coincidentally on the same day that I finished reading 'Personal History', the fascinating and comprehensive autobiography of the owner and long-time publisher of The Washington Post Katharine Graham. The film, directed by Steven Spielberg, tells the story of the newspaper’s fight in 1971, along with The New York Times, to publish the Pentagon Papers, a massive trove of government secrets which President Nixon’s administration attempted to cover up. Graham is played by Meryl Streep and the role of editor Ben Bradlee by Tom Hanks.</p>
