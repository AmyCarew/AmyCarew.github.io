			<h1 id="headline">Keeping an Eye Open by Julian Barnes</h1>
			<h2 id="date">9 March 2018</h2>
			<p id="text">I recently listened to a BBC Radio 4 interview between the writer Mark Haddon and the painter Tai-Shan Schierenberg. It was a fascinating discussion of their childhoods and professions, as they tried to find similarities in their work and working methods.</p>
			<p id="text">I’m not sure they came very close to bridging this gap, or whether it should even be bridged. In both painting and writing, there are elements of creation and elements of response, but each is positioned differently (and is constantly moving around) on this continuum. Julian Barnes, in his book ‘Keeping an Eye Open’, comes closer to defining a link which resonates with me. ‘It is a rare picture which stuns, or argues, us into silence. And if one does, it is only a short time before we want to explain and understand the very silence into which we have been plunged.’</p>
