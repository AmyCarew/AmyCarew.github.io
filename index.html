			<h2 id="date">28 January 2018</h2>
			<p id="text">Twenty of Degas’s pastels are being shown at the National Gallery until May 2018 in an exhibition entitled 'Drawn in Colour: Degas from the Burrell'. It appears to be auspicious timing: 100 years since the death of the artist on 27 September 1917. Exhibited outside Scotland for the first time since they were acquired by shipping magnate Sir William Burrell, these pastels are accompanied by several works from the National Gallery’s own collection. Rather more prosaically, the Burrell Collection building in Glasgow is currently closed for a revamp, hence the loan to the National Gallery in London.</p>
