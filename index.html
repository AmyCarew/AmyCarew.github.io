			<p id="text">Cézanne cuts an inscrutable figure. I have had this impression of him for some time and, after seeing the magnificent exhibition Cézanne Portraits at the National Portrait Gallery, I am convinced of it.</p>
			<p id="text">There are several self-portraits in the show (in total he painted 26). They are all quite different and do not give much of a clue to the character of the man. One of his earliest, a disturbing, ghoulish apparition, you would be forgiven for not recognising as Cézanne himself. Similarly with other subjects he painted multiple times, most notably his wife, Hortense Fiquet, expression or pose remains neutral and unreadable. His painterly techniques, use of the palette knife and distinctive brushstrokes strike you first.</p>
