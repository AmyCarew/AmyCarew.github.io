			<h2 id="date">30 July 2018</h2>
			<p id="text">It took four years of living in London for us to get to our first Proms. I claim it happened this year as part of my (re)immersion in all things classical, but more truthfully it probably goes back to laziness and ignorance on my part. I have now thoroughly educated myself and it turns out the Proms have a long and rather lovely history. The original aim, as explained on the BBC website, was ‘to present the widest range of music, performed to the highest standards, to large audiences.’ After over 120 years, promenading in the arena, cheap tickets, and an informal atmosphere are all still key features.</p>
