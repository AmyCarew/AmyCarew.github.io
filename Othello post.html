			<h1 id="headline">Othello at the Globe</h1>

			<p id="text">‘Pinch yourself’ moments don’t come along very often. It is one of the paradoxes of life that the grand occasions fail to live up to their hype, or are just so overwhelming that they can only be appreciated with hindsight. A true ‘pinch yourself’ moment creeps up on you unawares and is bound to be something insignificant, something which hadn’t occurred to you before.</p>
			<p id="text">I had a moment like this a few days ago. I was standing in the yard at Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre on a glorious summer evening. This site in itself, on the banks of the Thames, evocative of theatres in times past in its construction, and the host of so many productions in its history, would be enough to give anyone pause. But I was there watching Othello, a play that has been close to my heart for some time.</p>
			<p id="text">Twelve years before, almost to the day, I had been sitting in a classroom in the middle of Durban, South Africa, windows thrown open to a view of the sea from the ridge above the city. It was our English class and Othello was the Shakespeare set work of that year. Our teacher, a redoubtable woman whose bark was far worse than her bite, had in no uncertain terms proclaimed Iago as ‘the very worst, the most despicable villain in all of literary history.’ And we believed her.</p>
			<p id="text">As one of the more fluent readers in the class, I was often selected to read passages aloud. That day she chose me to read the part of Iago, to my involuntary dismay and then secret delight. It was the third scene of Act III when Iago sows the first seed of doubt in Othello’s mind about Desdemona and Cassio. To then be standing in the middle of London all those years later, and to hear the great Sir Mark Rylance say those very same words, is something I could not have imagined happening. Quite regularly Mrs Hurley herself read the part of Iago, and slathered his words with oozingly false flattery or spat them out full of venom. Rylance himself would have been impressed.</p>
			<p id="text">She brought Shakespeare to life for us. As we stumbled over the odd vocabulary, the ancient syntax, the metre, she helped us to see the big picture, the over-arching themes, the sheer genius of this man. In preparation to see Othello, I reread the play and was amazed at how much more I could pick up: the nuances, the witty asides, the theatrical vision of it. And then it all came to life before me on a stage open to the skies, skies that glowed pink and then slowly darkened as night began to fall.</p>
			<p id="text">This version, directed by Claire van Kampen, was wonderful. The acting was superb, not just from the star names like Rylance and Andre Holland, but from the whole cast who were full of energy and played both the comic lines and the dramatic end to perfection. Holland’s Othello was dreamy and assured, in a calm, controlled kind of way, which made his descent into the depths of jealousy all the more tragic. Rylance as Iago was a masterclass: the barely noticeable stutter at the start of many of his sentences, his quiet, unassuming way of speaking, his feigned innocence and cheeky pandering to fellow characters and the audience alike. It deceived you into liking him all the while knowing how much you should hate him. And by the end you truly did, his malevolence so much more insidious for being motiveless.</p>
			<p id="text">By casting actors of different races in all the key roles, the theme of racism was largely removed from this production. This served to emphasise the struggle for power, the problems with masculinity and the male ego, and the dangers of irrational hatred which are at the heart of this play.</p>
			<p id="text">I often think back to those days at school, many of which were quite unhappy for me, but English, taught by Mrs Hurley in my final three years, was a light, an hour of the day that I always looked forward to. I still have copies of the poems we studied, which I annotated frantically in pencil, trying to pin down every word she said. They are a relic of another life now but nevertheless, every time I read a poem, I think of those lessons. And every time I watch a play, particularly Shakespeare, I am reminded of a fearsomely sharp-tongued red-haired woman with a wicked sense of humour and a twinkle in her eyes.</p>
