			<h1 id="headline">An Evening at the Proms</h1>
			<h2 id="date">30 July 2018</h2>
			<p id="text">It took four years of living in London for us to get to our first Proms. I claim it happened this year as part of my (re)immersion in all things classical, but more truthfully it probably goes back to laziness and ignorance on my part. I have now thoroughly educated myself and it turns out the Proms have a long and rather lovely history. The original aim, as explained on the BBC website, was ‘to present the widest range of music, performed to the highest standards, to large audiences.’ After over 120 years, promenading in the arena, cheap tickets, and an informal atmosphere are all still key features.</p>
			<p id="text">We went on the evening of another incredibly hot day in this record-breaking summer. If I said in my previous post that the Rodin exhibition was a sanctuary, then entering the Royal Albert Hall was like stepping into a sauna. Not even this, however, could spoil my enjoyment of what followed.</p>
			<p id="text">The programme began with the world premiere of ‘What did we see?’ by Tansy Davies, a haunting piece inspired by 9/11. Although this was a contemporary composition, in principle it echoed the long tradition of composing and creating in response to world atrocities. It was edgy and unsettled, which was particularly well conveyed by the non-traditional use of the instruments. Underlying the main themes there was a sense of phones ringing and distant sirens. The last part felt like the aftermath: how it must have been as darkness fell on that terrible day, or at 3am the next morning. An eerie, nightmarish stillness, and yet not still at all.</p>
			<p id="text">This was followed by Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 5 in E flat major, ‘Emperor’. The first movement with its compulsive arpeggios and chromatic scales running up and down the keyboard was played masterfully by Paul Lewis. There was such a beautiful contrast then to the second movement, which is hymn-like and gentle. The theme, which begins in the strings and then is echoed by the piano later, astonishes and surprises my ear every time I hear it.</p>
			<p id="text">The concert ended with Symphony No. 2 in D major by Brahms. It resonated sunshine and heat, conjured up images of running wild over grassy fields and was filled with the energy of summer, the particular way one’s energy rises and is sapped at the height of the day, then rises again. The final movement had wonderful pace and driving force. It was an appropriate end to that warm July day.</p>
			<p id="text">Ben Gernon, the conductor, was excellent throughout, capturing the distinctive mood of each piece with aplomb. Born in 1989, this was his first time conducting the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra at the Proms, and we felt a strange connection to him, sharing both the year of our birth and our first visit with him.</p>
			<p id="text">The audience was so enthusiastic and appreciative despite the heat, and the spirit of the Proms, as imagined all those years ago, was very much present in the Royal Albert Hall that evening. We will be back.</p>
