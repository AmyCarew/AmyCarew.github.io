			<h1 id="headline">Monet and Architecture</h1>
			<h2 id="date">19 April 2018</h2>
			<p id="text">On the first Sunday after our arrival to live in London, we went to see ‘Rembrandt: The Late Works’ at the National Gallery. I was beside myself with excitement. We drank £1 Pret filter coffees as we waited in the queue on a bitterly cold but sunny January morning. Time (admittedly a relatively short three years) has done nothing to dull my delight in these wonderful exhibitions I am so lucky to visit regularly and often.</p>
			<p id="text">This weekend was the turn of ‘Monet & Architecture’, also at the National Gallery, which inspired my reminiscing. For me, Monet and memory seem to fit together: he paints the way memories feel in my mind. In parts vividly clear, lucid, even brilliant. In others hazy and shadowed and interrupted. In Monet’s paintings, these distinctions are quite random, like the way we remember things. His repetition of the same motifs in different lights is like recalling the same image with a slight nuance each time. The introduction to the exhibition alludes to something similar: ‘buildings evoke memory and stand in for the human presence.’</p>
			<p id="text">The first three rooms focus on ‘picturesque views’. I particularly loved ‘The Hut at Sainte-Adresse’ with its foreground of dappled greens and yellows displaying Monet’s eye for foliage. The contrast of this with ‘Vétheuil in Winter’ across the room, all icy blues and palest pinks, shows a painter with an instinct for season, place and atmosphere. Contrasts continue throughout the exhibition: colour and movement in one frame with white stillness in another. Saturated with bleached hues. Thin paint with thick.</p>
			<p id="text">City scenes are grouped together next, including two wonderful paintings of the Gare Saint-Lazare. Smoke and steam interrupt the solidity of machine and architecture in an almost humorous way. As the exhibition notes suggest, ‘the painting inverts our expectations’ and in so doing gives us something to look at, something to ignite our curiosity.</p>
			<p id="text">The row of five depictions of Rouen Cathedral along one wall is remarkable. Abstract up close, encrusted with layers and layers of paint, the structure materialised as I paced slowly backwards. In ‘Rouen Cathedral, setting sun’, there is a gorgeous light, a juxtaposition of stone pink against the turquoise of the evening sky.</p>
			<p id="text">The Venice paintings are a fitting conclusion to this exhibition, imbued as they feel with sadness and dereliction: none of the works include people and the colours are mournful and sombre. The two paintings of the Doge’s Palace are identical in all but light and give the truest impression that Monet painted, in his own words, ‘the air that surrounds the bridge, the house, the boat’.</p>
			<p id="text">I walked around sighing repeatedly with delight and wonder, experiencing vicariously the joy with which Monet painted, his loving touch, his loving eye. The beauty was almost too much to bear and yet I could hardly tear myself away.</p>
