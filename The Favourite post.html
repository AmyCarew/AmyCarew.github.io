			<h1 id="headline">The Favourite
			<h2 id="date">13 January 2019</h2>
			<p id="text">It feels rare in our world of social media, live news, and constant information supply to be surprised by anything and perhaps even rarer to be able to approach something with few pre-conceived ideas. Yet this was my experience watching The Favourite last Saturday. It was completely refreshing to walk out of the cinema and still be processing what I had seen. In fact, I couldn’t voice an articulate opinion on it until we were almost halfway home.</p>
			<p id="text">I had seen the billboards on the Underground, I knew it was led by women in the three main roles, I could tell it was a period piece. I was particularly keen to see Olivia Colman and I think I was vaguely aware the film was about Queen Anne (though I was ignorant of the years of her reign and any other details of her life).</p>
			<p id="text">To then be confronted with what is mostly a comedy, bordering even on the farcical, accompanied by a compelling and relentless score, with invasive camera work and daring close ups, about the deep complexity of female relationships and with the male characters in the film made a mockery of or swatted away as insignificant: well, it was a delight to alternate between helpless giggling and open-mouthed staring, having little idea as to how events would unfold next.</p>
			<p id="text">Much of the surprise element comes from the way the film uses familiar scenes and events and then subverts them. It has the grand staging and lavish costumes one would expect from a depiction of royalty in the early eighteenth century but the way it is filmed imparts a distinctly surrealist edge to what looks on the face of it to be very traditional. The characters are consistent with any similar period piece: a monarch, courtiers, ladies-in-waiting, politicians and a largely ignored inferior class. The way they interact with one another though feels fresh, honest, often outré, and far from implausible.</p>
			<p id="text">At the centre of it is Queen Anne and her right-hand lady, Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough. Olivia Colman is superb as the really terribly sad figure of Anne: insecure, haunted by fourteen failed pregnancies and the early deaths of her three surviving children, and dogged by ill-health. Colman deserves every accolade she has thus far won. Rachel Weisz’s Duchess of Marlborough is so hungry for power she appears to have immersed herself in it like it’s a very austere bath. Emma Stone plays the interloper, Abigail Hill, to her full, over-the-top, enterprising and manipulative potential.</p>
			<p id="text">The ensuing liaisons between these three, the sex, lies, threats and scandal, make for a gripping and graphic story (I wouldn’t recommend watching it with your parents). Would it have had the same impact had it been about three men? Part of the appeal certainly comes from seeing women occupy so much screen time. But they are good in their own right and not just because they are women where we’re used to seeing men. The film shows the world firmly from their perspective: it doesn't feel like it was made by a man about women. The director, Yorgos Lanthimos, has done well here.</p>
			<p id="text">It captures a woman’s reliance on a man at that time, her disgust at most men’s behaviour, and the relentless struggle to extricate herself from male subordination. It also illustrates that women, far from being the caring, gentler sex, are capable of as much violence and hatred as men, towards themselves and each other. They are willing to be selfish, stab each other in the back in their quest for power, recognition or independence.</p>
			<p id="text">That’s not to say it’s necessarily right for women to behave in this way but just that the common portrayal on screen of women either as a man’s love interest or as part of some supportive sisterhood is unrealistic and incomplete. The Favourite goes a long way to remedying this and it does it with an always surprising and often peculiar combination of flair, humour and tragedy.</p>
