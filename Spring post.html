			<h1 id="headline">Spring</h1>
			<h2 id="date">3 June 2018</h2>
			<p id="text">Spring has felt very short this year. Admittedly it got off to a slow start, with snow late in March and the cold weather continuing into April. We spent the first half of May visiting family in sunny autumnal South Africa and, by the time we returned to London, spring was already in full swing.</p>
			<p id="text">If you go by the meteorological seasons then technically spring is already over, the official first day of summer being 1 June. But according to the astronomical calendar it is the solstice on 21 June which marks the transition. So happily there are a few more weeks of spring to enjoy yet.</p>
			<p id="text">I have been reading the beautiful books, ‘The Morville Hours’ and ‘The Morville Year’ by Katherine Swift. The lyrical and precise way she describes her garden in the grounds of the Dower House at Morville, the creation and continuing growth of it, has made me much more aware of the seasons, the weather, and the passing of time. In ‘The Morville Hours’, she sensitively combines the history of this patch of Shropshire land with her own story of making a garden and finding a home. The book is structured around the Hours of the Divine Office, the segments that monks divide day and night into, which are also linked to the seasons. It is a wonderful, mesmerising read.</p>
			<p id="text">Even without the prompt of these books, the sudden onset of spring was hard to ignore. From one week to the next, perhaps even overnight, everything had grown, blossomed, bloomed. Each morning as I looked out of the window or stepped out of the door, all I could think of was the opening of Gerard Manley Hopkins’s poem, ‘Spring’:</p>
			<p id="text">‘Nothing is so beautiful as Spring – <br>When weeds in wheels, shoot long and lovely and lush’</p>
			<p id="text">On the subject of plants and flowers, we recently saw the work of Nic Bladen at Everard Read London. He is a South African sculptor who casts in bronze whole plants (flowers, leaves, stems and roots) from the actual cuttings themselves. They are works of astonishing delicacy and lifelike accuracy. The only respect in which they do not resemble the Cape fynbos they are created from is in their complete stillness, transplanted to this gallery in London, casting their shadows onto white walls.</p>
			<p id="text">The end of ‘meteorological’ spring concluded with a magical evening at the Royal Opera House’s Spring Gala, a diverse programme of opera and ballet. The Opera Company performed quite a traditional repertoire, the highlight for me being Pretty Yende singing ‘Ombre légère’ from ‘Dinorah’. She sang with lightness and joy: it perfectly suited the occasion.</p>
			<p id="text">The Royal Ballet programme was completely wonderful. I uttered an involuntary gasp as the lights came up on Vadim Muntagirov posed on a platform at the back of the stage in ‘Dance of the Blessed Spirits’ from ‘Orpheus and Eurydice: Dance in the Elysian Fields’. There was lovely storytelling in ‘The Farewell pas de deux’ from ‘Winter Dreams’, made even more poignant by the accompaniment of a piano on stage. An added bonus was a very contemporary piece choreographed by Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui to the music of The Nutcracker’s ‘Grand pas de deux’. It was incredibly stark and very sad, and juxtaposed against the immediately familiar music, it completely inverted our expectations. The first half concluded with the finale from Balanchine’s ‘Symphony in C’ which was crisp and technical and all lines of arms and legs: just what you’d expect from Balanchine’s choreography.</p>
			<p id="text">The second half had humour, gravity and romanticism. I especially loved seeing an excerpt from a new ballet ‘The Unknown Soldier’. Created by Alastair Marriott for Francesca Hayward and Matthew Ball, it is due to premiere at the ROH next season. The evening concluded with a rousing medley from Carmen featuring both the Royal Opera Chorus and the Royal Opera House Youth Opera Company. We left the theatre speechless, satiated, walking on air.</p>
			<p id="text">While I was in South Africa, I found myself missing London: the cool, milky light of a spring morning in the northern hemisphere, the gradual ascent into day and the slipping descent into night, the sense of time expanding and stretching as summer comes closer. Now back, a quote from ‘The Morville Year’ captures my feeling perfectly:</p>
			<p id="text">‘It was achingly beautiful – that brief moment when the garden is poised between late spring and high summer […] Everything green and succulent and growing. And I nearly missed it.’</p>
