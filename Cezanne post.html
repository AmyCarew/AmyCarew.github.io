			<h1 id="headline">Cézanne</h1>
			<h2 id="date">26 November 2017</h2>
			<p id="text">Cézanne cuts an inscrutable figure. I have had this impression of him for some time and, after seeing the magnificent exhibition 'Cézanne Portraits' at the National Portrait Gallery, I am convinced of it.</p>
			<p id="text">There are several self-portraits in the show (in total he painted 26). They are all quite different and do not give much of a clue to the character of the man. One of his earliest, a disturbing, ghoulish apparition, you would be forgiven for not recognising as Cézanne himself. Similarly with other subjects he painted multiple times, most notably his wife, Hortense Fiquet, expression or pose remains neutral and unreadable. His painterly techniques, use of the palette knife and distinctive brushstrokes strike you first.</p>
			<p id="text">The exhibition clearly shows the progress of Cézanne’s continual experimentation with paint. In the first few rooms, you see how many times Cézanne used family and close friends, subjects who were close at hand. He painted his wife 29 times, not, it appears, out of all-consuming adoration, but because she was around and willing to sit for him. He treats her with detachment, and also a sort of straightforward tenderness.</p>
			<p id="text">It is through the repetition of subject that you see the development of Cézanne’s technique, his inspired use of colour, and an obsession with pleats, patterns and stripes. In a painting called 'Hortense Fiquet in a Striped Skirt', my eye was drawn not to her face or the vivid red chair she sits on but to the light rippling over and weaving through the stripes of her skirt. It covers almost all the lower half of the canvas. Equally stunning are three paintings of Madame Cézanne in a red dress. I could have looked all day at that dress, a rich plum colour, texturally dense in parts and delicately reflective in others.</p>
			<p id="text">The exhibition also includes several examples of his later paintings of the servants and peasants from his Provençal family home. These are arguably the more famous of his portraits and display a more consistent and resolved style than his earlier works. In them you see how he distorted and simplified perspective: a spoon standing upright in a cup, enlarged hands and lengthened limbs, whimsical precursors of the modern and surrealist art which was to follow Impressionism.</p>
			<p id="text">It is said that he did not intend for his portraits to be over-analysed as representations of character; this exhibition shows that he would rather call attention to the way he painted. So it turns out that I am no closer to understanding the man. But it was a delight to walk amongst his portraits and glimpse, oh so momentarily, the workings of his painting mind.</p>
