			<h1 id="headline">Balenciaga: Shaping Fashion</h1>
			<h2 id="date">4 June 2017</h2>
			<p id="text">Much is made of the way Cristobal Balenciaga’s clothes, particularly the dresses and capes, conceal a woman’s figure and transform it into something less traditionally feminine. But walking through the exhibition at the V&A, Balenciaga: Shaping Fashion, I had the overriding impression of a designer with the highest respect for the female form, and an unerring eye for highlighting its beauty.</p>
			<p id="text">The show itself is first and foremost about the garments and the genius that created them, from conception to voluminous, exquisite reality. There are many examples on display, inventively curated and intertwined with Balenciaga’s story.</p>
			<p id="text">He trained as a tailor and his consummate skill lay in clever cutting and allowing the fabric to lead the design. The importance of the silhouette is clear in all his designs and it is the choice of material that gives many of the dresses their sculptural quality.</p>
			<p id="text">Clothes, though, are nothing without someone wearing them. They are not art in their own right and Balenciaga seemed to understand this. Some of his most innovative designs, the balloon hem being one example, were created with the motion of the body in mind. As the wearer walked, the dress would fill with air, transforming and almost breathing.</p>
			<p id="text">He created the sack dress, the bracelet sleeve and a neckline that specifically exposed the collarbone and the nape of the neck. All of these were astonishing in their modernity and in the way they flattered the female form, so distinct from the hourglass shape favoured at the time.</p>
			<p id="text">As Balenciaga himself said, it all begins with the shoulder. So many of his dresses, coats and capes, hang from, and hinge on, the shoulder. As a creator and a maker, it is the simplicity of his vision and the quality in the execution which make him one of the very best and this show a delight of discovery. </p>
