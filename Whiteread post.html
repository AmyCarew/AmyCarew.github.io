			<h2 id="date">23 December 2017</h2>
			<p id="text">One Sunday in December, we had forty minutes to spare before the shops on Piccadilly opened. More than enough time to visit Rachel Whiteread’s exhibition at the Tate Britain, I thought. But how wrong I was.</p>
			<p id="text">This beautiful, big space was a haven from the chaos of Christmas shoppers and festive season tourists. Being able to roam freely around art of this kind, barely encountering another person, is a privilege in a city like London. Even more, we found delight in trying to work out how the sculptures had been cast and what they had been cast from. There was much to provoke our thoughts and conversation.</p>
			<p id="text">Negative space is generally unassuming and sometimes rather dusty. Think of the gap on a bookshelf between the books and the wall. It doesn’t exactly call attention to itself. In her work, Whiteread has brought these gaps and spaces front and centre, by casting the emptiness inside or around objects, as opposed to the more traditional casting of something to make a replica. So many wonderful examples are on display here: tables, boxes, hot water bottles (‘torsos’) and, most memorably, on a large scale, shelves, stairs, a whole room.</p>
			<p id="text">She uses different materials of varying colours. I found it amazing how differently I responded to a sculpture depending on the material: the slightly porous look of plaster, industrial style concrete, transparent and jelly-coloured resin.</p>
			<p id="text">While the works are definitely sculptural and quite abstract in form, they are also everyday objects. In this, they reminded me of ceramics, of pots and bowls and vessels, albeit inverted and on a massive scale. The displays of smaller objects – toilet rolls and the like – echoed this thought. I was spell-bound by the comforting familiarity and yet mind-bending strangeness of every sculpture, powerfully reminded that a sign of a remarkable artwork is one which makes you look twice.</p>
			<p id="text">I truly admire the brilliant conception and strong conviction present in Whiteread’s work. Forty minutes could so easily have been much longer, surrounded by the spaces in which our lives are enacted, made concrete.</p>
