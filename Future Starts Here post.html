			<h1 id="headline">The Future Starts Here</h1>
			<h2 id="date">23 May 2018</h2>
			<p id="text">My first impression as I entered the V&A’s new exhibition, ‘The Future Starts Here’, was of a giant playroom for grown-ups. It is spread across one large space lit like a bowling alley, with the exhibits of the first section housed in fluorescent-coloured plastic structures. A huge drone is suspended from the ceiling; the largest object ever exhibited at the V&A, it has the wingspan of a Boeing 747.</p>
			<p id="text">I felt unsettled in so many ways.</p>
			<p id="text">The V&A is historically a collector of objects about the past, and perhaps occasionally the present. Or so it seems to me every time I visit the museum. Curating a major exhibition about the future then is a difficult task. And though the attempt is admirable and will hopefully attract a new audience, it doesn’t feel entirely comfortable yet. This may be partly to do with the subject matter, the future being a rather uncomfortable place for many of us.</p>
			<p id="text">Individually there are some interesting items on show, grouped under the headings of various questions, for example: ‘We are all connected but do we feel lonely?’ This particular section is a display of the many devices we seem to need throughout our lives, including, amongst the usual suspects, a cot which rocks and soothes a baby, and a wetsuit-like garment which improves movement and muscles in the elderly.</p>
			<p id="text">There is a politically centred section with an example of a pink Pussy Power hat. An extensive display of architectural models for new developments includes Apple’s new headquarters, a carbon neutral city in Abu Dhabi, and a crowdfunded bridge in Rotterdam. Another question, ‘What if your boss is an algorithm?’, further demonstrates the difficulty of choosing objects to illustrate the future, simply because no one knows what the objects are, or they are not tangible, or both. I don’t think it’s easy to choose objects from the past either, but it’s easier to weave from them the threads of a story, anchored in history, the imagination constrained just enough to allow it to roam freely.</p>
			<p id="text">A large container of sand with the earth’s topography superimposed onto it, which changes as you shift the sand around, enhances the feeling of a child’s playground. Another item, the first coffee machine in space, injects a welcome bit of humour as the card in front of it asks, ‘If good coffee is a priority for astronauts, what does that tell us about space exploration?’ With a smile I recall the tasters of Soylent, an unappetising meal replacement drink, offered near the beginning of the exhibition. What, I wonder, does this tell us about humans?</p>
			<p id="text">The final sections explore the effects of climate change in Africa and the (im)possibility of living forever, ending the exhibition on a serious note.</p>
			<p id="text">Collectively it feels incoherent, jumbled. It is difficult to draw patterns, to know what’s important and what’s not, with no benefit of hindsight. Perhaps this is intentional, to make us all feel like children: daunted, excited, impatient, our attention spans woefully short. Change is constant and no one really knows what’s just around the corner, although this exhibition gives us some very good ideas.</p>
