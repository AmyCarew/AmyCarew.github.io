			<h1 id="headline">All Too Human</h1>
			<h2 id="date">24 April 2018</h2>
			<p id="text">I loved that this exhibition is all about paint and painting, and through this medium exploring ‘what it is that makes us human.’ As the Introduction to ‘All Too Human’ at the Tate Britain also states, ‘Many of the artists in the exhibition have spoken of painting as an activity that cannot properly be expressed in words, existing beyond the limits of verbal language.’ I have not attempted to put the act of painting into words here but I have tried to articulate my response to the wonderfully diverse, visually thought-provoking collection of works on show.</p>
			<p id="text">The exhibition is so much more than just flesh and figure, and very cleverly so. Surrounding two astonishing and overwhelming rooms of work by Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon are many carefully selected paintings, serving to complement and offset these main rooms, and also to captivate in their own right.</p>
			<p id="text">Paintings by Walter Sickert reminded me of Degas: in particular one of a naked woman seen in a mirror, shown in her own quiet space. ‘Citadel 1961’ by F.N. Souza depicted a city like a stained glass window, evoking Schiele’s landscapes. The room of work by William Coldstream and Euan Uglow was my favourite: the shifting layers, the piecing together, the complete lack of disguise of the process of painting and mark-making, most obviously seen in Coldstream’s measurement marks, visible on his canvases. I was transfixed by Freud’s portrait of Frank Auerbach, how the same marks form the planes of his face and the soft folds of his t-shirt, even the curls of his hair. Paula Rego’s wonderful pastels loomed off the walls, each an entire story in a single frame, as my sister remarked, ‘Like a scene from a play.’ I would have loved to see more work like that shown in the final room where paintings by Celia Paul, Cecily Brown, Jenny Saville and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye were hung, pulsing with emotion and so relatable especially to me as a woman. The chronology of the exhibition put them at the end but they felt sadly like an afterthought.</p>
			<p id="text">Overall, and particularly with the Freuds and Bacons, I was left with the impression of the myriad ways you can capture a human. In Freud’s case with an unflinching exactness; in Bacon’s with a tortured, relentlessly shifting distortion. This exhibition made me think of that uniquely human desire to inflict gratuitous violence, but then, perhaps in redemption, of our tender familiarity with our own bodies and the bodies of those we love.</p>
