			<h1 id="headline">Modigliani</h1>
			<h2 id="date">17 January 2018</h2>
			<p id="text">The faces and bodies of many different people currently fill several galleries at the Tate Modern. But with a first glance around me, all I could see was one man: Modigliani. This impression echoes the remark made by the subject of one of the portraits, Jean Cocteau. It is quoted in the show and many other places besides: ‘It doesn’t look like me. But it does look like Modigliani, which is better.’</p>
			<p id="text">Superficially, Modigliani’s works are highly stylised. Paint application is heavy and often unmodulated and the colours he used heightened and harsh. In his earlier work, there is little consistency. In ‘Bust of a Young Woman’ (1908) and ‘Nude Study’ the brushstrokes are loose and sketchy and the colours dull, almost overmixed. ‘Young Gypsy’ is heavily caricatured and ‘Bust of a Young Woman’ (1911) is angular and severe. He seemed to be searching for his style, a thought made even more remarkable by the utter conviction he showed once he found it.</p>
			<p id="text">The link between his earlier, more experimental work and the instantly recognisable long necks and almond eyes of his later paintings appears to be the period he devoted to sculpture. At the exhibition, in a quiet side room, beautifully monotone against the colour of his portraits, are a selection of stone heads. Arranged in a grid on the diagonal, all facing the same way, the elongated lines of each are emphasised. There is strength in this sculpting and genius in the conception: cool European stone juxtaposed against tribal African mask.</p>
			<p id="text">We do not know what we have lost from Modigliani’s return to the canvas, limited as he was by his health and financial circumstances. But this exhibition certainly shows what we have gained. At a time when portraiture was still unfashionable, he showed assuredness and resolve in his painting. Bold, strong composition; beautiful curved lines, displayed here in several of his drawings; eye-watering colours. All of these translate perfectly to a two-dimensional surface. What his highly recognisable style disguises (and cleverly so) is the nod in his work to other artists and movements. In their poses and smoothly rendered flesh, his peachy nudes bring to mind the alabaster white ones of Titian and later Cabanel. The complementary blues and oranges of ‘Gaston Modot’ and the pointillism in the face of ‘Portrait of the Painter Frank Haviland’ are a nod to Impressionism. And there, among the brushstrokes of ‘The Beggar of Livorno’, is a glimpse of Cézanne.</p>
			<p id="text">I particularly loved the final sections of this exhibition. His later paintings are gentler, more reflective. The paint is less heavy. He uses more blue. This is shown most beautifully in ‘The Little Peasant’. A row of six portraits of his lover and the mother of his child, Jeanne Hébuterne, is moving and evocative. In three of them she assumes the classic Modigliani pose, her head tilting this way and that. The other three are headshots, relatively uncommon for Modigliani, with the two on each end particularly wonderful depictions of a serious young woman. He has painted her eyes in these two and in that told us something about himself and their relationship. While his work may have continually questioned the notion that a portrait should be a perfect likeness to be successful, through painting others, he captured his own spirit.</p>
