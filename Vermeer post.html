			<h2 id="date">29 July 2017</h2>
			<p id="text">Contrast appears to be the principal purpose of the exhibition, Vermeer and the Masters of Genre Painting. And the first of these contrasts is immediately obvious upon entering the galleries in Dublin: the beautifully lit rooms of paintings compared to the dark, poorly lit scenes in the painting themselves.</p>
			<p id="text">On closer inspection, there is repeatedly one exception to this rule. In every one of his paintings, Vermeer revels in the use of natural light. This provides the second contrast. The other painters in the show rely largely on artificial, and possibly even imagined, light sources. To them, light is a necessity to make the scene visible. In Vermeer’s works, it is part of the scene, a form of ornament. Some of the most finely painted sections of canvas are those of a bare wall illuminated by sunlight from an unseen window to the left or right, particularly in the exquisitely beautiful Woman with a Pearl Necklace.</p>
			<p id="text">The curators of this exhibition have organised works by Vermeer and his contemporaries around the categories of genre painting, or scenes from everyday life. This highlights the tendency of these painters to take inspiration from one another and, in many cases, to copy the same settings.</p>
			<p id="text">The technical execution of the paintings provides another distinct contrast. Vermeer’s contemporaries, many very accomplished artists, used tiny, careful brushstrokes to paint realistically. Vermeer’s approach, the use of flattened blocks of colour in many areas of his paintings, particularly the fabric of dresses and furnishings, is astonishingly modern. This more abstract style is immediately noticeable and refreshing.</p>
			<p id="text">Vermeer’s paintings made me think of some work of Diarmuid Kelley’s which I had seen recently in London. Kelley’s painting of fabric and his skilful use of flat sections of colour and natural light sources from the side of the scene owe some credit to the pioneering work of Vermeer in the mid-17th century.</p>
			<p id="text">While Kelley’s paintings are far larger in scale and arguably more dramatic in subject matter, there is the same beautiful stillness in the staging. He uses unpainted sections of canvas to great effect and has a perfect awareness of just where to allow image to dissolve into emptiness. This, and borders of unprimed linen, create contrasts within each work.</p>
			<p id="text">Using contrast is a clever way to look at something. While Vermeer is indisputably one of the very best ever painters, it is in comparison to others that his genius is all of sudden freshly apparent.</p>
