			<h2 id="date">31 October 2017</h2>
			<p id="text">I am ashamed to say that I have never been to an opera. As a lover and even once a performer of classical music, I feel as though this is a gross failing on my part. However because of this I can say that the new exhibition at the V&A, Opera: Passion, Power & Politics, is a wonderful entry point into this remarkable art form.</p>
			<p id="text">The exhibition is as much for the novice as for the experienced opera goer. In fact anyone with half an ear will appreciate the soaring arias and rousing choruses playing through the headphones as you walk around the beautiful, new Sainsbury gallery.</p>
			<p id="text">The space is divided into several sections tracking the development of opera from 17th century Venice to the present day. The curators of the show have, along this timeline, illuminated elements of design, architecture, art and history, which is what we have come to expect from a V&A show such as this. </p>
			<p id="text">The displays and video clips range from the exquisite to the tragic to the macabre. I was particularly taken with a piano that Mozart had played, beautifully decorated down to the vertical surfaces on the end of every key, black and white.</p>
			<p id="text">With a subject as broad and sweeping as opera, the scope of this exhibition is understandably limited. At times, the behind-the-scenes look may seem simplistic, especially to a theatre professional. But the historical and political context of the operas selected was enlightening and thought-provoking, and the music an excellent accompaniment.</p>
			<p id="text">This show more than lives up to its name and, even more, it has inspired me to book a ticket to my first opera.</p>
