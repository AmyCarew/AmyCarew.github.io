			<h1 id="headline">A Visit to Vienna</h1>
			<h2 id="date">21 February 2018</h2>
			<p id="text">My first impression of Vienna was mirrored in my new-found knowledge of the Austrian artist, Egon Schiele. It was also coloured, inevitably, by the events of the 20th century, by Edmund de Waal’s book, ‘The Hare with Amber Eyes’, and the Austro-Hungarian roots of my own family.</p>
			<p id="text">Vienna is a stately city. The buildings have a grand, old-fashioned beauty, simple in structure and ornate in decoration. It feels like a serious place, in the best possible sense of the word. A place where the development of music, art, architecture and culture is, and always has been, important. But serious too in its sad history. The Jews as a community were expunged from the city no less than three times since the first record of a Jewish presence in 1194.</p>
			<p id="text">Schiele’s first collector, Heinrich Benesch, wrote of him, ‘Schiele was not only an unusual artist but also an unusual person. The main feature of his character was seriousness; not a gloomy, melancholy, depressed seriousness, but rather the quiet seriousness of a person fulfilled with his spiritual task.’</p>
			<p id="text">I did not find many of Schiele’s paintings appealing, but they drew me in nonetheless. The edge of darkness to his subject matter and his unique view of the world combine to make his works gripping and fascinating. I was most attracted to his often intricate landscapes. In a letter, he wrote about creating ‘visions of a landscape’, about how the movement of trees, water and nature ‘are all reminiscent of similar movements in the human body’, about creating feelings inside yourself that are like seasons: ‘it is this wistfulness that I want to paint.'</p>
			<p id="text">In a landscape of patchwork green hills with a lake beyond, coloured pink by the low sun, two trees are painted with exquisite delicacy. Little circles of gold are dotted along the ridges of each hill, like blinking lights. There is such graphic detail in this painting but it is also extremely evocative of both a place and a feeling. The trees are autumnal; one has lost practically all its leaves. But I like to think the sun is rising and the dots are the light of morning activity. A juxtaposition of hope and eagerness against the cold onset of winter.</p>
			<p id="text">Besides Schiele, I revelled in the pattern and decoration of Klimt, who managed to successfully pull off the combination of beautifully still and serene faces, and the riotous flowers or heavily decorated fabric swathing the rest of his canvases. There was a definite mix of styles and willingness to experiment in all the Austrian art I saw, a legacy of the Impressionists perhaps. Yet through it all ran a current of strong design and graphic influence.</p>
			<p id="text">The Austro-Hungarian and Jewish roots of my own family were brought up several times in my childhood. The most well-recounted part of the story was their flight to the Isle of Skye sometime in the mid-1800s and the subsequent anglicising of their name, ‘Kienzler’ to ‘Kinsler’, in 1920. According to a family tree in my mother’s possession, my three times great grandfather was a watchmaker and his son a lace-weaver. Could they have plied their trades in the very city of Vienna? On the Sunday of our visit, when the sun came out over the wide boulevards, the clarity of light reminded me of Paris. But (and this could be my imagination) I felt a stronger connection there than I had done in Paris. Although I do not know exactly what part of the Austro-Hungarian empire my family were from, I had the vaguest sense of a parallel life. Missed opportunity or blessing in disguise: how thin the line between these two.</p>
