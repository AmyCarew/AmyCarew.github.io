			<h1 id="headline">The Post</h1>
			<h2 id="date">6 January 2018</h2>
			<p id="text">The first awards-season screening of 'The Post' was held in New York City in November last year, coincidentally on the same day that I finished reading 'Personal History', the fascinating and comprehensive autobiography of the owner and long-time publisher of The Washington Post Katharine Graham. The film, directed by Steven Spielberg, tells the story of the newspaper’s fight in 1971, along with The New York Times, to publish the Pentagon Papers, a massive trove of government secrets which President Nixon’s administration attempted to cover up. Graham is played by Meryl Streep and the role of editor Ben Bradlee by Tom Hanks.</p>
			<p id="text">The film took only nine months to make. I think the book, at a hefty 677 pages, may have taken me half that time just to read. You cannot help but see the parallels between many of the events described, including the Pentagon Papers and the Watergate scandal, and those of today. According to Spielberg, this relevance inspired the urgency in making the film.</p>
			<p id="text">The book as a whole, and the specific incident of the Pentagon Papers, deals with both the importance of a free press and issues of sexism in the workplace. It is a paean to investigative journalism and unbiased reporting. It emphasises the pride in providing people, in the tangible form of a newspaper, with their right to know the truth. In the film, Spielberg has apparently prioritised the portrayal of the physical printing process. Compared to the dissemination of news on social media, this offers a pointed metaphor for the state of journalism in our world today.</p>
			<p id="text">Of course, excellent newspapers still exist, with journalists dedicated to the distribution of fair and honest reporting. But the public’s trust in mass media is low and, in general, the importance of newspapers seems to have diminished. Because of social media, we no longer need to rely on newspapers for information as much as it was necessary to thirty or forty years ago. This is not to say that we blindly believe what we are being told on digital platforms but we do have more control over what we want to hear. For the most part, we follow what we want to follow, creating an echo chamber without contradictory beliefs. Coupled with this, a suspicion of hard facts and unnamed sources results in less importance being placed on investigative journalism. </p>
			<p id="text">Online platforms can spread news far more quickly. In addition, it is the sensationalist stories, the polarising views that gain the most coverage. Dry, factual reporting is largely ignored. The short form of tweets and summaries of news headlines on our phones make it easier to twist stories, to spread false information by taking it out of context. This leads to newspapers spending time debunking fake news, thereby giving it even more publicity. When politicians themselves begin using these platforms to spread propaganda, the problems worsen. They don’t need to rely on newspapers putting out the right message: they no longer see newspapers as a kind of conscience, a filter on their behaviour and choices.</p>
			<p id="text">In the digital age, it is more difficult to separate opinion from news, both because it is no longer physically delineated and because the lines between these have become more blurred. Part of the problem with all of these issues is the change in method, from something physical to something digital. But when the form of something changes, should that change how we perceive the content, how we react to it?</p>
			<p id="text">Bradlee, Graham and The Washington Post had a tenacity, a never-give-up attitude and a commitment to fact-checking. Now that we, the public, are involved in the spread of news and our own views, do we apply these same standards to ourselves? Nixon may have been in violation of the First Amendment when he tried to prevent the Pentagon Papers from being published. But, on the other side of the coin, it is our responsibility to exercise our right to freedom of speech with care and respect.</p>
			<p id="text">The other theme of the book and the film is Graham’s position as the first female publisher of a high-profile American newspaper. While she acknowledged that she had no real choice other than to take over the paper on the death of her husband, she also spoke movingly throughout the book about her intense and plaguing self-doubt. An internalised sense of inferiority and self-perceived lack of qualifications led her consistently to overemphasise her failures. This was exacerbated to a large degree by several men around her undermining her authority and decision-making. The sad thing is that this attitude towards women was perfectly normal at the time. Even sadder is that men today still think they can get away with such behaviour.</p>
			<p id="text">The Washington Post has been chronicled on the silver screen before, most notably in 'All The President’s Men', a 1976 film about the Watergate scandal and based on the book of the same name by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward. Graham recounts in her autobiography the decision that was made to leave her character out of this film, as it would be too confusing for people to understand her role and why she as publisher should be involved. Personally I wonder if there was an expectation that the public wouldn’t understand a woman in such a prominent position of power. Despite not wanting the publicity of being portrayed in a movie, she naturally felt slighted by the omission and at the end of 1974 wrote to Bradlee in retort: ‘Thank god for the reality, it will never be in any book or any cruddy movie. It’s much too good for that.’ While she is resolutely in 'The Post' and although I’m sure Spielberg, Streep and Hanks have done a brilliant job, I can imagine that Graham would feel much the same about the whole thing as she did back in 1974.</p>
