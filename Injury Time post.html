			<h1 id="headline">Injury Time
			<h2 id="date">7 February 2019</h2>
			<p id="text">The phrase ‘injury time’ was imprinted on my brain from a young age, the words unconsciously memorised before I could understand them. Each weekend, if there was an important rugby game on, the question would be asked by my dad, ‘How much injury time?’ in tones ranging from the mildly curious to the slightly edged with stress, depending on who was playing and how close the game was at that point.</p>
			<p id="text">The concept of injury time in sport – time added on at the end of a game for stoppages in play, usually due to injuries requiring treatment – is an interesting one. Reflecting on this recently, it occurred to me that it’s one of those strange ways time can be distorted, and a few seconds or minutes made to feel longer or shorter or more important than identical minutes which have just passed. It both is and isn’t ‘additional’ time: you are simply being compensated for time you would have had, had there been no stoppages. But it is more time spent playing the game than you were originally expecting.</p>
			<p id="text">Injury time is also imbued with a greater sense of urgency. Whether you are winning or losing, there is an added incentive to hold on or to press on, to make the most of every second, knowing as you do that the end is so very imminent.</p>
			<p id="text">These thoughts were partly inspired by Clive James’s latest (last?) anthology, ‘Injury Time’, given to me as a Christmas present by someone who knows me wondrously well. What struck me first was the breadth of James’s knowledge and interests. That this writer, this poet, who is also a broadcaster and critic and has exquisite taste in music, should choose a sporting term as the title for possibly his last book of poems: this is someone I admire and can identify with. Knowing his circumstances, that he has been actively expecting his own death for the last few years, I also wondered whether he regarded this extra time as recompense for time taken away previously or simply as a bonus at the end of the game of life that he had been led not to expect.</p>
			<p id="text">Whichever it is, and perhaps neither, he has used it to the full in this beautiful collection of poems. In his foreword, he states, ‘It is quite pretentious enough to evoke the image of an exhausted footballer still plugging away with legs like lead.’ There is absolutely no sense of exhaustion or plugging in these poems, although the comparison does give some idea of the energy they cost him.</p>
			<p id="text">The first few are openly about his approaching death. ‘Anchorage International’ in particular reads like an extended metaphor on the subject. In ‘The Rest is Silence or Stroking her Feet to Opus 131’, he writes of Beethoven and his Ninth Symphony, composed when he was almost totally deaf: ‘To die / Was really all the man had left to do, / And yet he did this.’ </p>
			<p id="text">He picks out various other figures from the world of music and culture, intertwining them with his life experiences. In amongst these is also ‘Ayrton Senna Killed at Imola’ and ‘Tactics of the Air Battle’, a poem that imagines a letter from a dead World War II fighter pilot grown old – illustrating a diverse range of subject matter.</p>
			<p id="text">Some are love poems. He writes in ‘Panis Angelicus’: ‘A lifetime has gone by since we first listened / To music and, wrapped in it, found each other.’</p>
			<p id="text">He speaks eloquently of his writing, his poetry, his ‘apprenticeship in artifice’. About crafting a poem. And always with the sense of time running out, even when he is not directly referring to his illness. ‘In Your Own Time’ contains some advice to himself: ‘It’s no crime / To spend these stolen hours as if your fate / Depended on the balance of a phrase.’ Yet he manages to strike a positive note, steal a backward look in gratitude, as in ‘Recollected in Tranquillity’: ‘Should things look / As if I knew despair, of this be sure. / I loved it here.’</p>
			<p id="text">Nowadays there is technically no such thing as ‘injury time’ in rugby matches. The much more practical but far less mysterious method of the referee stopping his watch each time play stops and then restarting it again is now used. However, the team with the ball in hand at the end of eighty minutes may continue to play until they lose it or score. There is a frantic, heightened romanticism about these last few moments, a devil-may-care determination and tenacity in the face of imminent demise that cannot be found at any other time of a match. I was delighted to rediscover this in Clive James’s words. And on re-reading the poems, one last thing occurred to me – this man knows how to write a final line, to finish in triumph, like the scoring of a winning try to end a match.</p>
