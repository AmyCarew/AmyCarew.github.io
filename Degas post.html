			<h1 id="headline">Degas: Drawn in Colour</h1>
			<h2 id="date">28 January 2018</h2>
			<p id="text">Twenty of Degas’s pastels are being shown at the National Gallery until May 2018 in an exhibition entitled 'Drawn in Colour: Degas from the Burrell'. It appears to be auspicious timing: 100 years since the death of the artist on 27 September 1917. Exhibited outside Scotland for the first time since they were acquired by shipping magnate Sir William Burrell, these pastels are accompanied by several works from the National Gallery’s own collection. Rather more prosaically, the Burrell Collection building in Glasgow is currently closed for a revamp, hence the loan to the National Gallery in London.</p>
			<p id="text">Degas’s favoured choices of subject matter are all in evidence here: dancers, racehorses and women at their toilette. Although the motifs are familiar, I was surprised and delighted by the innovation and creativity in the techniques Degas used when working in pastel. To look at these works up close, and to see beyond what he depicted to the evidence of mark-making, is a rare privilege. It was a commonly held view before the era of the Impressionists that one sign of a good artist was their ability to hide all trace of the individual marks making up a painting. Degas and other Impressionists, notably Monet, tore up the rulebook in this respect.</p>
			<p id="text">The layers upon layers of cross-hatching, the brilliant use of colour, the areas of the surface left unworked: it is wonderful to see, in the medium of pastel, how Degas drew. In one particular example, the tutu is greatly underworked, suggested only in charcoal outline with slashes of vivid green and orange to highlight where the colours catch the light. It is striking and daring.</p>
			<p id="text">While I think the opportunity to see his method is the most fascinating part of the exhibition, I cannot ignore two other important facets to Degas’s work: what he chose to paint and the viewpoint he chose to paint from.</p>
			<p id="text">Dancers, women bathing and racehorses: did he see all of these in the same category? Yes, to an extent, he did, as subjects for his art. The oft-quoted ‘I have perhaps too often considered woman as an animal’ springs to mind. Many of his remarks in a similar vein have probably been taken out of context and, along with perpetual bachelorhood, have been used to make a case for his misogyny. Consistently depicting women in contorted poses, often naked and from behind (‘through a keyhole’ as he said) has not helped.</p>
			<p id="text">However, I would argue that in many ways he did women a favour. Particularly in his ‘women bathing’ series, he showed them in their own environment, absorbed in things they were doing for themselves. Not beautiful and smoothed over and latently sexualised as many had done before. He freed women from the need to present themselves in a certain way for men. He showed them as they are, reaching, bending, muscles tensing, in a tactile and accessible way.</p>
			<p id="text">I was conflicted seeing this show, particularly as the Hollywood and British MPs sex scandal was at its height at the time. Accusations of misogyny, founded or not, linger and taint. Today these lead to high-profile resignations and public excoriation. Of course, Degas lived and worked in a different time. Now his depictions of women are not considered a form of gender discrimination, as they may have been in the 19th century (for the wrong reasons, ironically). But is any form of bias against anyone on the basis of gender, race, religion or orientation ever acceptable? And how much can we separate the work of a person from their beliefs, if at all? I suspect that, once enough time passes, we see art as purely of aesthetic, historical or technical relevance, distanced from the moral associations of the artist.</p>
			<p id="text">A few years ago, BP’s sponsorship of the National Portrait Gallery’s portrait competition was questioned on the grounds of ethical standards. Climate activists protested against it. The debates over accepting the sponsorship of oil companies are ongoing. In the realm of a gallery or even one individual work, should it matter who sponsored it, who the patron or the painter is and what beliefs they hold?</p>
