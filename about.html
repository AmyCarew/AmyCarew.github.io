				<h1 id="headline">About | Amy Carew</h1>
				<p id="text">I love words and how they look. I like arranging them. I love definitions, dictionaries and crosswords. Posters and signs. Newspapers. Poetry. When I have a thought, I am quite often compelled to write it down. When I have a dream, I want to tell a story.</p>
				<p id="text">I was born in South Africa and grew up in Durban. I studied a commerce degree at the University of Cape Town and qualified as a chartered accountant while working in Johannesburg. I have lived in London since 2015. It has inspired me to write.</p>
