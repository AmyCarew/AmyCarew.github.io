			<h1 id="headline">The London Library</h1>
			<h2 id="date">23 September 2017</h2>
			<p id="text">We were fortunate enough to take a wonderful and illuminating tour of the London Library during Open House weekend in September. It is a special place. Behind a deceptively narrow but elegant frontage, opposite St James’s Square in Piccadilly, are housed enough books to fill 17 miles of shelving.</p>
			<p id="text">I believe, somewhat fancifully, that spaces absorb and retain something of the past, a spirit that is captured by walls and ceilings, that collects like dust motes, never discernible to the eye except in piercing sunlight.</p>
			<p id="text">This is probably a figment of my indulged and romanticised imagination. Perhaps the presence we feel in these special places is simply the manifestation of our collective imaginations, whirring furiously to recreate the people and events of the past.</p>
			<p id="text">It is not difficult, in the Library’s book-lined, red-carpeted entrance, to conjure up spectres of George Eliot, Charles Dickens or Virginia Woolf pacing through to the hushed environs of the Reading Room. A.S Byatt herself used that room as the setting for the opening of her novel, Possession. I must have read that opening at least three times without attributing it much significance. Now, having been to the Library, I see and understand so much more. Ah, London, how you have opened my eyes!</p>
			<p id="text">I wanted to describe the bookstacks. How the first thing to hit you is the smell. Thousands upon thousands of pages, a reincarnation of wood, at once dead and alive. Musty but kind of warm and yeasty and enveloping. How the Victoria grid-like walkways harshly echo your footsteps. How the books towering up on either side are imposing despite their fragility and how the steel grate beneath your feet is permeable despite its strength.</p>
			<p id="text">But then I opened up my copy of Possession, misappropriated from my mother who got it from who knows where a long time ago. I sniffed deeply between the pages, the scent subtly reminiscent of those bookstacks, and reread Byatt’s description. She had said it all already and mine can never hope to match up.</p>
			<p id="text">I remembered then that I quoted from Possession in my speech on our wedding day. I found the page strangely easily and reread those words too. This book is important to me. I was reminded anew why I believe in spirits, feelings, uncanny coincidences and surprising connections. Sort of like the connections in the alphabetical classification of the Science and Miscellaneous section in the Library, where you might find Agriculture and Alchemy side by side, or Ballooning and Banking, Circus and Civil Service, Sundial and Superstitions, Lotteries and Love.</p>
