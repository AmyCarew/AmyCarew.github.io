			<h1 id="headline">Impressionists in London</h1>
			<h2 id="date">11 February 2018</h2>
			<p id="text">The purpose of this exhibition, as explained in the first room, is to display the work of artists exiled to London from Paris and France during the Franco-Prussian war and ensuing Paris Commune. According to its title, you might reasonably expect an Impressionist exhibition but Impressionism being on the rise during the same time period seems to be purely coincidental. You may feel a premonition that what is inside is not exactly what it says on the tin.</p>
			<p id="text">The next few rooms confirm this. The work of various artists active in London and roughly during the era of the Impressionists is on display. A large amount of space is devoted to Tissot, who meets these two criteria. But when one thinks of the characteristics of Impressionism: vivid, complementary colours, loose brushwork, and natural light and movement, very few are present in his paintings. Many are of high society and could be anywhere, so even the ‘London’ part of the title seems a little lost here.</p>
			<p id="text">Progressing further through the exhibition, work by Legros and Carpeaux seems similarly misplaced. The curation too is old-fashioned and unimaginative. Only in the fifth room do you feel that things are slightly back on track with paintings centred on sports, crowds and parks. The pointillism of Pissarro is particularly good at conveying the singular vibrancy and freshness of the English summer. There are several examples of his lush countryside scenes, and a painting he made of the Thames, where the water and the sky practically blend into one almost white expanse, flecked with hints of blue and red.</p>
			<p id="text">With a section on the fogs of London, you move closer to something resembling the title of the exhibition. Three of Whistler’s nocturnes are very smooth, and equally smooth a claim he made in 1880: ‘I begin rather to wish myself back in my own lovely London fogs! They are lovely, those fogs – and I am their painter!’ There are several other candidates in the running for this claim: Turner immediately springs to mind and, amongst non-painters, Dickens, who described them so vividly in the opening to ‘Bleak House’.</p>
			<p id="text">But after walking into the seventh and penultimate room of this exhibition, you realise that there is really only one person who can ‘own’ London’s fogs. Over a few years at the turn of twentieth century, Monet worked on more than 100 canvases for his ‘Thames’ series. Each view of the river and Westminster shown here is exquisitely shape shifting with different levels of focus and contrast. These silhouettes of a city are so completely different to scenes illuminated by clear Parisian light; you can see why they allured Monet. Their largely dichromatic palette of blues and purples must have inspired Rothko and particularly his paintings hanging in the Tate Modern: they share a similarly quiet and meditative sense. And the room has a similarly beautiful feeling. Dimmed light and aubergine walls allow the paintings to radiate towards you in the most atmospheric way. The air itself feels misty and thick.</p>
			<p id="text">You leave reluctantly, thinking that this room alone gives credence to the title of the show, and makes it worth seeing. It’s a pity you have to walk through all the others to get there.</p>
